        <h2>How it works</h2>

        <p>A tigit is a point driven ticket.  Each tigit is given a point reward value from 10 - 100.  The tigit creator assigns points from their daily and lifetime point allotments.  Once a person's points are used up they will have to wait until the following day to create more tigits.  Other users can claim a tigit to work on.  As soon as the tigit is complete the user is awarded the points.</p>
    </div>

        <h2>Rewards</h2>

        <p>Besides being showered with awe and reverence, the most immediate reward is the ability to create more tigits.  Other awards might be real world tangible items or badges or whatever else I think up.</p>
